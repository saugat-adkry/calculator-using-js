# calculator-using-js
This repository contains the source code for a simple calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and displays the result on the screen. The calculator also has a clear button to reset the input fields.

The source code is organized in separate files for each language: index.html for HTML, style.css for CSS, and function.js for JavaScript. The JavaScript code uses event listeners to detect user input and perform the calculations. The CSS code defines the styling and layout of the calculator.

Feel free to clone the repository and experiment with the code. Any feedback or contributions are welcome!
